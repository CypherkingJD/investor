"There are two schools of thought on investing — Technical and Fundamental analysis — and each uses a variety of metrics to assess whether to invest in a stock." [1]

"Technical analysis uses past price and trading history to assess whether a stock is a sound investment." [1]

"The technical analyst believes that the stock’s price incorporates all publicly available information." [1]

"Therefore, historical trading activity and price movements are key indicators for future movements." [1]

"Fundamental analysis ... eschews past trading history and focuses on financial and economic variables that affect a stock’s price." [1]

"Fundamental analysts would counter that past price movements and activity, dictated by supply and demand for a security, aren’t necessarily indicative of future performance." [1]

"Yet there were red flags along the way— questionable accounting methods (Mark-to-Market), and management’s questionable conduct — and focusing on these aspects would have given a more nuanced picture of the stock’s future movements." [1]

"The two camps can be unified on a practical level." [1]

Technical analyst:
Buy:
* "short-term moving average is above its long term moving average" [1]
* "Short-term is usually defined as a 50-day moving average" [1]
* "long-term is usually defined as 200-day moving average" [1]

Sell:
* "short-term average falls below the long-term average"

Good signs to fundamental analysts:
* "posted strong financial growth over the past few years" [1]
* "strong cash flow and balance sheet" [1]
* "continue its growth due to management successfully executing on its business strategy" [1]
* financial ratios:
- Earnings-Per-Share (EPS) ==  “a company’s net profit divided by the number of common shares it has outstanding.” [1]
- Price-to-Earnings (PE) == "a company’s share price to its earnings per share” [1]
- Current Ratio == "a company’s ability to pay its short term debt — usually debt that is due within a year." [1]
- Debt-to-Equity (DE) == "measures a company’s liquidity (how well a company can pay its debts)" [1]
- "the economy at large" [1] --> See https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=medium+python+investing+the+ecomony+at+large&mid=1C08CDD3002497C717B21C08CDD3002497C717B2&FORM=VIRE
